The Kendall–Tau distance $\\tau(<1, <2)$ is the number of swaps needed to obtain the order $<1$ from $<2$, normalized by dividing by number of possible swaps $\\frac{n \\cdot (n−1)}{2}$. Hence, $τ(<1, <2)$ is always between $0$ (if $<1$ and $<2$ are identical)\n",
    "and $1$ (if $<1$ is the reverse of $<2$). Values smaller than $0.5$ indicate that the orders are closer together than expected from two random orders, while values larger than $0.5$ indicate the opposite. Values further away from $0.5$ imply higher correlation between two orders."
